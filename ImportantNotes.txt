The folder contains two Python notebook files. To run the code follow the steps:
 1. Create an EEGLAB Dataset from experimental public data (see the paper) for each subject with the preprocessing steps mentioned in the paper.
 2. The EEGLAB dataset(.set) file is used as the input to the MTEGraph.ipynb file.
 3. Once the MTE graphs are created for two cognitive events, pass those graphs to the SimBrainNet.ipynb file.
 4. Check the SimBraiNet algorithm first from the paper and then follow different operations (substitution, insertion, and deletion) 
 to compute the Similarity score between graphs.
